        <h2>Consultation</h2>

            Bowling Club. </p>

            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>We completed the purchase of the former Mansfield Bowling Club site with a view of submitting a fresh
                planning application that is more in line with the aspirations of the local community.</p>
            <p>ince then, we have consulted local residents on their prioritise and concerns regarding the site’s future
                development and provided updates on the designs as they have progressed through winter 2020 and spring
                2021.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h2>Have Your Say</h2>
            <p>Together with Wolff Architects and Andy Sturgeon Design, we are pleased to present our proposed scheme
                that we hope to submit to the London Borough of Camden soon.</p>
            <ul>These proposals take feedback into account from all local residents, and will provide a care home
                facility which includes:
                <li> A community garden, orchard, and allotment space</li>
                <li>Children’s play area and rain garden</li>
                <li>Arrival and drop-off space accessed via Croftdown Road</li>
                <li> A tranquillity garden and seating area</li>
                <li>A separate residents’ courtyard nestled within the buildings</li>
                <li>Three tennis courts for community use</li>
                <li>A tennis pavilion to support the site’s history of sporting use</li>
                <li>A sustainable build utilising solar panels, increased energy efficiency, and better biodiversity
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can find a presentation of the scheme <a class="boldertext">here</a></p>
            <p>Please feel free to email any feedback to:<span class="boldertext">mansfieldbowlingclub@kandaconsulting.co.uk</span></p>
            <h2>Previous Consultation</h2>
